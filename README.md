# AthenaCognis

**AthenaCognis** is a self-hosted, AI-powered document management and knowledge assistant.
Inspired by tools like *Paperless*, it combines full-text search, multi-provider AI extraction, project and task management, research bibliography tools, and productivity tracking, all in one web application that keeps your data on your own infrastructure.

## History
I'm currently doing a PhD after obtaining a DevOps engineer degree. Before that, I was an AI & DevOps intern at a startup, my managers were genuinely happy with my output, but they often struggled to follow what I was actually working on. The problem wasn't the work itself; it was me. I've never been great at writing reports, summarising progress, or communicating what I've built.

Starting a PhD made that gap feel even more urgent. Research demands exactly the kind of structured communication I'd always avoided. So I did what any developer would do: I built a tool to solve the problem.

AthenaCognis started as a personal system to organise and track my own work, documents, tasks, notes, time, research papers, in one place, with AI doing the heavy lifting on summaries and reports so I don't have to. What began as a workaround for my own weaknesses turned into something genuinely powerful that saves me a significant amount of time and has noticeably improved how I communicate my work. It lets me focus on what I actually enjoy: research and building things.

I've open-sourced it because the problem it solves isn't unique to me, and if it ends up being useful to other researchers and engineers, that's a nice bonus. (A widely-used open-source tool that supports scientific work also makes for a pretty solid PhD contribution, not going to lie.)

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application runs as five Docker services on a shared internal network:

| Service | Image | Purpose | Host Port |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
| `back_db` | `mariadb:10.6` | Relational database storing all metadata, tasks, links, notes, and settings |, (internal) |
| `pma` | `phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin` | Web-based database admin UI | `PMA_PORT` |
| `ollama` | `ollama/ollama` | Local LLM inference server; models stored in `DATA_PATH/ollama` |, (internal) |
| `back` | Custom (FastAPI) | REST API + background AI daemons + file management | `BACK_PORT` |
| `front` | Custom (Streamlit) | Web UI; communicates with the backend over the internal network | `FRONT_PORT` |

**Background daemons** (run as threads inside the `back` container):

- `OCRManager`, processes OCR and BLIP image-captioning tasks from the queue
- `TranscriptionManager`, transcribes audio and video files
- `SummarizeManager`, generates LLM summaries and keyword lists
- `PreviewManager`, generates image/text/archive preview thumbnails
- `ChatManager`, handles streaming LLM responses asynchronously

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- At least **8 GB RAM** allocated to Docker (Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources)
- A storage path on your host for persistent data

> **Note:** A GPU is optional. The app runs on CPU alone; local AI tasks (OCR, transcription, summarisation) will simply be slower.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/athenacognis.git
cd athenacognis
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env_ex .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the values (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) below).

### 3. Start the application

```bash
./up.sh
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:<FRONT_PORT>`.

### 4. (Optional) Pull a local LLM model

Go to **Settings → LLM Settings → Local Llama**, enter a model name (e.g. `llama3.2:8b`) and click **Pull Model**. Browse available models at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library).

### 5. Stop the application

```bash
./down.sh
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

All core configuration is done via the `.env` file:

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PROJECT_NAME` | ✅ | Internal Docker Compose project name | `athenacognis` |
| `USER_NAME` | ✅ | Your name, shown in the dashboard greeting | `chad` |
| `DATA_PATH` | ✅ | Absolute path on the host for all persistent data (files, database, models, caches) | `/data/athenacognis` |
| `BACK_PORT` | ✅ | Host port for the FastAPI backend | `8400` |
| `FRONT_PORT` | ✅ | Host port for the Streamlit frontend | `8401` |
| `PMA_PORT` | ✅ | Host port for phpMyAdmin | `8402` |
| `DATABASE_PASSWORD` | ✅ | MariaDB root password | `supersecret` |
| `APP_PWD` | ☑️ optional | Password to protect the web UI; leave empty to disable authentication | `mypassword` |
| `LOGIN_TIMEOUT` | ☑️ optional | Session duration in seconds when `APP_PWD` is set (default: 86400) | `86400` |

API keys for cloud AI providers (Mistral, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq) are stored in the application database and configured through **Settings → LLM Settings**, they do not need to be set in `.env`.
